Demo android API 31 splash screen with Nativescript

Android 12 introduces a new splashscreen paradigm, which is detailed [here](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/splash-screen).

A good writeup on this an a step by step guide is given [here](https://itnext.io/a-comprehensive-guide-to-android-12s-splash-screen-api-644609c811fa).

This repo contains an app created from the `Hellow World` angular template, updated to use the `alpha` version of `@nativesript\android` and built with the `next` version of the NS cli. ( i.e. pre 8.2 versions).

The original splash screen is shown for API<31 phones and the new type of splash screen for API>=31 phones.

( Well it works on the emulators anyway).
